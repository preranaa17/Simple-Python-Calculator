# My Python Project: Simple CLI Calculator

I have built this calculator using Python to understand how functions and loops work together. This is a basic command-line tool where you can do math operations easily.

## What I have used in this code:
- **Functions:** I created separate functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This makes the code organized.
- **While Loop:** I used `while True` so the calculator keeps running until the user types 'exit'.
- **Error Handling:** I used `try-except` so that if someone types a word instead of a number, the program shows a friendly message instead of an error.
- **Division Check:** My code specifically checks if the second number is zero to avoid math errors.

## How it works:
1. Open the file in any Python environment (like Visual Studio).
2. Enter the first number.
3. Choose an operator: `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`.
4. Enter the second number.
5. See the result instantly!
6. Type **'clear'** to clean the screen or **'exit'** to stop.

## Tech used:
- Language: Python 3
- Modules: `os` (for clearing the console screen)
